### Instructions
- Media folder must be unzipped in project to build.
- The 2020 version of the LARC engine (not publically available) must be installed and environmental variable `LARCENGINE_DIR` must be set.
- More stuff that I'll add later... (This project can't actually be built anyway as it requires engine code which is not available to the public)
