# Spire Panic!
Spire Panic! is a game that I and another student at UNT, Andrew Marxer, developed for Intro Game Programming. I wanted to backup the code somewhere for reference and just as a demonstration of what I have made. **This project cannot actually be built, as it requires engine code that is not publicly available.** The engine used is not my property and I cannot distribute it. Additionally, even if I could, this project uses an incompatible and outdated version of that engine.

## Can I at least play it?
Yeah, [here](https://drowsyprof.itch.io/spire-panic). There's no source code in the built version so this should be fine.

### Instructions
- Media folder must be unzipped in project to build.
- The 2020 version of the LARC engine (not publicly available) must be installed and environmental variable `LARCENGINE_DIR` must be set.
  - This is technically impossible to obtain unless you also happened to be in that Fall 2020 class. Sorry.
- DirectX Toolkit 12
  - `DIRECTXTK12_DIR` environmental variable set to DirectX Toolkit 12 folder
  - `DIRECTXTK12LIB_DIR` environemntal variable set to the same folder's subdirectory `\Bin\Desktop_2019_Win10\`
- More stuff that I'll add later... Probably.
